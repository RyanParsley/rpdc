I have had an account for a little while now. But it was not until recently that I got &ldquo;it&rdquo;. There are <a href="http://wtfistwitter.com/" title="WTF is Twitter" target="_blank">plenty</a> of people <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/Twitter" title="Twitter in Plain English" target="_blank">explaining</a> twitter, but the &ldquo;it&rdquo; factor can/ will not happen unless you play with it*. I dabbled, but until saw the &ldquo;itis&rdquo; at FOWA first hand, I resisted. Now, I follow via IM with sms forwarding while I refresh a web page and sample 2 air clients. It&rsquo;s not a habit, it&rsquo;s cool.

One big reason of writing this post is in hopes to reach someone who was like me. &ldquo;Why would I want to broadcast an IM when I really don&rsquo;t have that many regular contacts that I communicate with via IM?&rdquo; I mean scalability doesn&rsquo;t seem that important when you don&rsquo;t have a large scope (I&rsquo;m looking at you Ruby On Rails Devs). I ask, &ldquo;Do you have any interest in what your favorite bloggers/ Internet Superstars are doing between posts (ZeFrank... we have learned our lesson, please vlog again, we all miss the show)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Would you like a grand equalizer that allows you to communicate real time to these &lsquo;A&rsquo; list internet types?&rdquo; Of course you would.

So, twitter is a paradigm shift in communication. Don&rsquo;t be a ludite, tweet (all the <a href="http://twitter.com/garyvee" title="Gary Vay... Ner... Chuk!" target="_blank">cool</a> kid&rsquo;s are doing it**).

*playing with it has no proven relationship to blindness.

** Cool is subjective and a particularly difficult case to argue in terms of web apps. Please consult your local Fonz if your are seeking an increase in cool.
