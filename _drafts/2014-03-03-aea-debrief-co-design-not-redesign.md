<p>At <a href="http://aneventapart.com/event/atlanta-2014">An Event Apart</a> in Atlanta, <a href="http://www.kevinmhoffman.com/">Kevin Hoffman</a> shared key points to consider to have better collaboration within your organization. Here&#8217;s a collection of take aways that resonated with me.</p>

<h2>Collaboration is good</h2>

<p>Collaboration is key to successful projects. Meetings are not the devil, they&#8217;re just often misunderstood. None of us are greater than all of us, even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Democracy">Axl Rose</a>. Build a successful &#8220;core team&#8221; that is cross-disciplinary, smaller than 7 people, has autonomy to make decisions and report to the rest of the team based on the vision. </p>

<h2>How to collaborate</h2>

<p>To foster collaboration, do not firewall meetings by department. Transparency within the company is a must. Secrets do not yield as much power as good collaboration. Also, do not exclude clients from decision making. They are the experts of their own domain, we should leverage that experience to inform what we build. Diverge (brainstorm) early. Brainstorm without judgment early. Make nothing taboo. People need to be heard before they can listen. Be sure to converge (agree on actionable next steps) before the meeting is over. Otherwise, what was the point. The bigger the team the more points of view have to be reconciled before a single point of view can be agreed upon.</p>

<h2>Why have a meeting?</h2>

<p>Meetings are about making decisions. If there are no decisions to be made, there should be no meeting. Plan Meetings around decisions, not people. Meetings probably shouldn&#8217;t have more than 7 people. At that point finding a consensus is at a threshold. Meetings are not appropriate formats to learn about the problem, they are for agreeing upon an approach after everyone builds expertise individually. </p>

<h2>Then what?</h2>

<p>Make short measurable experiments that focus on facts that matter. A great reveal is overrated (See also: Lean UX). Things will not go as planned. </p>
