I just finished the first day of a three day course I&rsquo;m taking on WPF. I have looked at it briefly from time to time, but this is the first real attempt at picking up the skill. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with WPF it is a relatively new way of writing user interfaces for .NET apps. I&rsquo;m hoping that with a stronger understanding WPF, I&rsquo;ll be better equipped to both design desktop apps.

As far as I&rsquo;m concerned the most interesting bit of WPF is XAML. After years of writing front-end code in HTML, my various attempts at picking up Win Forms felt ham-fisted. XAML is a bit of a &ldquo;through the looking glassrdquo; kind of experience for me as it&rsquo;s logically similar to HTML while syntactically different in every way. It&rsquo;s refreshingly familiar because, if you squint at it just the right way, it resembles bad HTML. Following along the sample code in this particular course book, I find myself building matryoshka doll interfaces not unlike building websites from nested tables. Also, all of the styling to this point has been declared inline. 

I&rsquo;m hoping that this is simply &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo; code examples and not &ldquo;best-practices&rdquo; for WPF front-end development. For the time being I&rsquo;m just going to follow the conventions in the book, but for future projects I&rsquo;ll definitely be investigating more elegant approaches.
