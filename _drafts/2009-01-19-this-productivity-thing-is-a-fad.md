I like the concept of productivity as much as the next guy (assuming the next guy isn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0142000280?tag=ryan0d-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=0142000280&adid=1CY6RYGFXJB48X9VE86K&" target="_blank">David Allen</a>).  That said, I have recently returned from the torpor of spending large quantities of free time reading about productivity instead of actually <em>getting things done</em>. If you're into reading about productivity, I recommend you check out what Merlin Mann has to say about it on <a title="Find the time and attention to do your best creative work. " href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a>.

Personally, paralysis by analysis is my biggest hurdle to getting things done. As such, productivity blogs/books/systems to ponder are probably not where my salvation lies.  Furthermore, spending time researching productivity to get more time is like trying to get rich by clipping coupons. I&rsquo;m not exactly arguing that productivity is a bad thing, just that I&rsquo;m not sure it should be such a high priority. For creative workers&hellip; doubly so.

If I&rsquo;m always working on scratching &ldquo;important&rdquo; items off my todo list, I&rsquo;ll never purge all of the fun stuff that is buried down on my someday/maybe list. Those are the excursions that often times spawn unique solutions for many would be mundane challenges. I&rsquo;m not relinquishing my trusty moleskin, I&rsquo;m just going to start filling it with creative bits instead of priorities.
