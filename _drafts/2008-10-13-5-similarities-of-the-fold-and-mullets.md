<p>It recently occured to me that there are more than a couple similarities between these two unfashionable things. Here is the <em>long and short</em> of it:</p>
<ol>
<li> There is no reasoning with mullet enthusiasts.</li>
<li> Both have fishy origins</li>	
<li> One is an ape drape one is monkey see monkey do.</li>
<li> Both seem like a compromise between style and business (see also: business in the front&hellip; party in the back), but are really just absurd.</li><li> At first glance, both concepts seem dated. Under closer evaluation you realize neither was ever a good idea.</li>
</ol>
Do not make this Achy-Breaky Big Mistakie!
