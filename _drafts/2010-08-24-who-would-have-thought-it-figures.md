While it&rsquo;s not shocking <em>that</em> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/24/motorola-snaps-up-280-north-for-20-million/">someone snatched up the talent of 280 North</a>, <em>who</em> aquired them (more to the point why) brings a smile to my face that can only be conjured up by sweet&hellip; sweet irony. Motorola (the hardware company) has aquired a startup &ldquo;dedicated to advancing the state of the art on the web.&rdquo;

<a href="http://280north.com/">280 North</a> is probably most notable for creating <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a>, &ldquo;an open source framework that makes it easy to build desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.&rdquo; The framework and team are quite impressive, but why would a phone manufacturer care? According to a Motorola spokesperson states, &ldquo;We believe 280 North will be instrumental in helping us continue to foster the Android ecosystem with innovative web-based technologies and applications.&rdquo; 

280 North is a team that so whole heartedly loves the way Apple products come together, they <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/06/cocoa-on-the-web-280-north-objective-j-and-cappuccino.ars">reimplemented Cocoa and Objective-C in JavaScript</a>. Motorola has recruited a brilliant, Apple-enthusiast, team for the betterment of Android. I wonder if they&rsquo;ll be trading in their iPhones for Droids.
