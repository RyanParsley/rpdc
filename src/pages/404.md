## 404: Page Not Found

The page you're looking for doesn't exist. In the industry, we call that a 404.
They happen for lots of reasons. Maybe the page doesn't exist any more, maybe it
never did. Perhaps mistakes were made typing the url?

## Notes

If you were looking for
a [note](https://ryanparsley.com/note), they change a lot (such is the way of a
garden). If I made a mistake and lost a page, let me know via [an
issue](https://github.com/RyanParsley/rpdc/issues).
