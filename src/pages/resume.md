I've been building software professionally for over 22 years, moving between
startups, agencies, and large enterprise environments. This career diversity has
taught me that architectural rigor is paramount, regardless of the context.

For the last seven years, I’ve specialized deeply in enterprise Angular and
TypeScript architecture, where I set technical standards and governance. My
technical obsession is code quality: specifically, dialing in pedantic linters
to push run-time surprises all the way back to compile-time errors. This mindset
naturally led me to study the philosophy and idioms of Rust.

I am a proven leader who architects solutions end-to-end, and I treat mentorship
as a first-class responsibility for driving the adoption of new tools and
architectural standards. My professional focus has been to drill deep,
establishing a commanding expertise in TypeScript and front-end architecture. My
next personal goal is to expand the breadth of my skills by achieving fluency in
Rust.
