I'm warming up to the idea of calling microblog shaped content "activities" to
disambiguate between them and "proper" blog posts.

Does anyone do that? Seems like an obvious name considering ActivityPub, but
I've not seen anyone with a stream of Activities.

I feel like note is more common, but I kinda want to use that word for something
else.
