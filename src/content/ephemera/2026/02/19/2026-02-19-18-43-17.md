I really should make more of a point to use this rust scripting feature.

```rust
#! /usr/bin/env -S cargo +nightly -Zscript -q
---cargo
package.edition = "2024"
[dependencies]
rand = "0.9"
---

use rand::Rng;
fn main() {
    let mut rng = rand::rng();
    println!("Hello, world! {}", rng.random::<u32>());
}
```
