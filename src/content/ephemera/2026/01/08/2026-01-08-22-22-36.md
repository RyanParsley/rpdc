Seems like an ideal size for gridfinity in those cute little harbor freight
toolboxes is 3 units deep by 3 units tall by whatever width is appopriate.

The drawer doesn't extend enough to easily get in the back so you want the bin
to span the depth. If you keep it 3 tall or shorter you can put the bin in more
easily than 4 even though 4 technically fits.

is working great for me.
