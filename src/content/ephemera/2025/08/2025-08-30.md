Just implemented automated POSSE syndication for ephemera posts using
CloudCannon's postbuild hooks!

If it goes the well, it should syndicate new ephemera to Mastodon and Bluesky
after each successful build.

Makes me a bit nervous to ship the first one because I don't know how to mock
all the complexity.
