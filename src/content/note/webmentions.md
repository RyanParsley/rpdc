I rather like the idea of a static site blog, but wouldn't mind enabling
conversations to know if any of this resonates with anyone out there.
Webmention may be just the thing I need. With this standard, I can see and link
to mentions of my content made elsewhere.

[This post](https://stevefrenzel.dev/posts/webmentions-in-astro-for-blog-posts)
looks like exactly what I need to get up and running. I can check in on
[webmention.io](https://webmention.io) to administer things.
