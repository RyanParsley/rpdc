I didn't want to over think methods and get hung up on classical versus jazz up front. I just wanted a reasonable path forward. [Essential Elements for Band](https://amzn.to/3WCsfbs) felt like a reasonable choice.

### 2023-11-15

Started making notes with some consistency using the register key. Started mixing in exercises 119-124 with my practice.

### 2023-12-30
Played through the first register quiz somewhat cleanly. No squeaks or big rhythm misses but could sound smoother.

Bottom Bass Boogie

###  2024-02-10
Star 17 (ex 125) sounded good enough for me to accept. I'm playing over the break more consistently, but not consistent yet.

###  2024-02-18

###  2024-09-21

I'm getting more consistent, but can't count on transitioning over the break to
go smoothly. Here are some cherry picked nice takes.

## Over the Break Plateau

Once I got to the exercises that incorporate the register key progress slowed down for me quite a bit.
