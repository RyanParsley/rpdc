I didn't want to over think methods and get hung up on classical versus jazz up front. I just wanted a reasonable path forward. [Essential Elements for Band](https://amzn.to/3WCsfbs) felt like a reasonable choice.

## Timeline

* 2023-07-21
  * Disassembled a clarinet
* 2023-07-24
  * First set of pads delivered
* 2023-07-26
  * Second set of pads delivered
* 2023-08-07
  * Started daily practice (gave myself the first star)
* 2023-08-19
  * Star 2 - 5
* 2023-08-27
  * Star 6
* 2023-09-04
  * Star 7
* 2023-09-10
  * Star 8 and 9
* 2023-09-14
  * Star 10 and 11
* 2023-11-15
  * Started making notes with some consistency using the register key. Started mixing in exercises 119-124 with my practice.
* 2023-12-30
  * played through the first register quiz somewhat cleanly. No squeaks or big rhythm misses but could sound smoother.
* 2024-02-10
  * star 17 (ex 125) sounded good enough for me to accept. I'm playing over the break more consistently, but not consistent yet.

## Over the Break Plateau

Once I got to the exercises that incorporate the register key progress slowed down for me quite a bit.
