I'm on a journey to drive an [EEZYbotARM](http://www.eezyrobots.it/eba_mk1.html)
with Rust. I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm learning electronics, rust, and
the Embassy framework at the same time. This is probably not the best way to
learn. Here is a link to my [github
repo](https://github.com/RyanParsley/robotArm) such as it is.

If you want to follow along, you'll need a Pi Pico and a Debug Probe (or second
Pico flashed to operate as one).

I picked the EEZYbotARM MK1 because it is made with the cheapest servos you can
find and I happened to have 5 of them already. This is fine for me because I'm
just looking for a platform to throw code at. There are more robust robot arms
out there if that's what you're looking for.

## Programming the pico

Cargo is set up such that `cargo build` will automatically upload your compiled
code to the pico so long as it and the Debug Probe are connected. If either are
absent, it won't work.

## Next actions

- learn how to drive a servo with embassy
- I'll use PWM, but will I use it directly or is there a lib/crate/utility to
  simplify the process?
- learn how to serve up a web interface on the pico w
- learn more about OTA firmware updates
- write code to move a servo based on the potentiometer values

## This is a big wad of stuff I don't understand

```rust
bind_interrupts!(struct Irqs {
    ADC_IRQ_FIFO => InterruptHandler;
});
```

### What is that `bind_interrupts` macro about?

> This defines the right interrupt handlers, and creates a unit struct (like `struct Irqs;`)
> and implements the right [`Binding`]s for it. You can pass this struct to drivers to
> prove at compile-time that the right interrupts have been bound.

### What is Irqs?

The [struct](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/git/rp2040/pio/struct.Irq.html) says:

> Type representing a PIO interrupt

#### Ok, but what is PIO?

[PIO](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/what-is-pio/) is a standardized way to communicate with tech that doesn't support protocols such as SPI and I2C. It's a more formalized and performant means of [bit banging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_banging). The "What is PIO" video went so far as to call out PIO is good for controlling robot arms. Sounds like I need to follow up and read [this hackspace] article(https://hackspace.raspberrypi.com/articles/what-is-programmable-i-o-on-raspberry-pi-pico).
