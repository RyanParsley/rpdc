## Tools that came in handy

- [VINCA Digital Caliper](https://amzn.to/4cbyoQr)
  - These are pretty cheap and get the job done
- [Stanley 33-231 Powerlock Tape Measure](https://amzn.to/4fuHNFO)
  - I love this tape measure so much I bought a second one. Metric and Imperial
    on the same small(ish) tape measure is great working in metric if you mostly
    think in inches.
