I used this with my [cigar box controller](/note/cigar-box-controller) build.
This firmware just works to get a DIY gamepad up and running. The only part that
was less than desirable in my context is I have buttons with leds in them that
aren't addressible like the firmware wants so I don't think I can use the lights
without switching to something more custom.
