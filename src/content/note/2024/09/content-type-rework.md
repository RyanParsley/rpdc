I'm working to evolve my personal site to be a blog, digital garden and source
of truth for my microblogging (POSSE). This is turning into a bit of semantic
churn as I'm want to do. I want my markup to be informed by microformats, but
conceptually, my 3 content types don't quite fit into the buckets that indieweb
define.

## Name collision

Microformats have a concept of 'note' but that is really a thing that looks like
a microblog post. I want to share _notes_ in a public PKM sense of the word.

## Working Idea

1. Articles: In-depth explorations, most structured and polished (still
   informal)
2. Posts: Quick updates and snapshots (microblog content for mastodon and
   pixelfed syndication)
3. Notes: Growing ideas and explorations (my digital garden that looks a lot
   like atomic notes)
