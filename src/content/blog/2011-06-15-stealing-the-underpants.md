A few weeks ago, I decided it was time to start blogging, again. I sat down to
my computer, loaded up my blog and realized that I _needed_ to relaunch
my blog first. After all, I had rushed this iteration of the blog together in a
hurried attempt to match the business cards that I had painstakingly designed. I
had never come back to apply the last bit of fit and finish that I told myself I
would. My blog was still powered by Drupal 6! Drupal 7 has been out for nearly a
year now. How could I possibly sit down to write under such conditions?

Weeks later and Iâ€™m still tinkering with the leading and column counts. I'm
still trying to figure out how many layouts I want in my responsive cascade. I'm
doing just about everything _but_ writing. Today, I put all of
those distractions aside, opened a text editor and started mashing away at the
keyboard. Finally, I started step one.
