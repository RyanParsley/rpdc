While Obsidian is great, lately I've been considering how to get similar
affordances with alternative tools. [zk](https://zk-org.github.io/zk/) looks
like a nice tool to consider for a more cli driven workflow. In this post, I
explore the configuration of zk to approximate the daily note workflow I
currently have set up with Obsidian.

## What does the template look like?

For personal stuff, I use a daily note to track habits and capture fleeting
notes during and about a given day. I don't want to give the file a name or come
up with a clever title each day. I also want to have some frontmatter attributes
ready for consistent tracking of daily habits like meditation and playing
clarinet.

```md

title: {{ format-date now '%Y-%m-%d' }}
created: {{ format-date now '%Y-%m-%d' }}
clarinet: false
meditate: false
tags:
  - daily
---

# {{format-date now '%Y-%m-%d'}}

## Navigation

[Yesterday](/journal/daily/{{format-date (date "yesterday") '%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}) <-> [Tomorrow](/journal/daily/{{format-date (date "tomorrow") '%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}})

## Tasks

## Notes
```

## Now, for some configuration

I like to store my daily notes in a folder structure like
`journal/daily/2024/03-March/2024-03-17.md`. It wasn't clear to me, as I read
the documentation, how to make use of a dynamic folder structure. Fortunately,
if you format the `filename` with slashes zk does exactly what I want.

```toml
# ~/.config/zk/config.toml
[group.daily.note]
filename = "{{format-date now 'journal/daily/%Y/%m-%B/%Y-%m-%d'}}"
template = "daily.md"
```

### Wire up an alias to make this easy

Now, you can create a daily not with the following command `zk new --group
daily`. That's cool, but kind of a lot to type. Back to `config.toml` and create
an alias like so:

```toml
# ~/.config/zk/config.toml
[alias]
daily = "zk new --group daily"
```

## Results... for now

Using [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) in Neovim shows a respectable start to a daily note.

Now, from any directory, I can type `zk daily` and a well-formed,
properly-named,file is generated as I like, where I like.

My next step is to set up Neovim to respect this configuration when I navigate
to a daily note that doesn't yet exist. However, this feels like enough for one
post.
