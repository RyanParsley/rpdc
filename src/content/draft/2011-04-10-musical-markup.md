I was frustrated with the lack of a way to easily make nice tabs quickly for
practicing guitar, so I spent a couple of hours thinking about a nice way to
mark up chords as html. I decided to share what I came up with so far in this
[demo](http://lab.ryanparsley.com/musicMarkup).

Currently, the plan is to write a compass plugin fairly soon to make it easy for
anyone to display chords and tabs. I'll share more of the process as I go along.
I'd love any feedback you have on my approach.
